// Leetcode Problem:
// appraoch:- take prev pointer which is intialised with null as This will become the new head of  the
// the reversed list as the original head's next pointer will become null when the list is reversed.
// traverse the list using current pointer (which is intially pointing to head of linked list) until
// the current!=null.
// Traverse the list while current is not null.
// For each node, temporarily store the next node (temp = current.next).
// Reverse the current node’s link by setting current.next to prev.
// Move prev to the current node(prev = current), which will be the new previous node for the next iteration.
// Move current to the next node in the list(current = temp).
// After the traversal is complete, prev points to the new head of the reversed linked list. Return prev
// TC: O(N) to iterate through the given linked list to reverse the linked list AND SC: O(1)

var reverseList = function (head) {
    let temp;
