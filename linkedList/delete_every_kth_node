// appraoch:- take a dummyNode and set its next pointer to head  of linked list. 
// it helps to manage the case where head value itself a deleted value.
// iterate the given linked list and initially count is 0 so, check if count is equal
// to k then delete that value from linked list with the help of prev and itrt pointer
// meanwhile increment the itrt and prev pointer. 
// Also change count which is again 0 if  we found the deleted value.
// Tc: O(N) to iterate through the given linked list AND SC: O(1) as we haven't take
// any extra space and only a few extra pointers are used.
