// appraoch:- 
// create the head of the doubly linked list by creating the first node with the value array[0].
// set a prev variable to keep track of the previous node, starting with the head.
// iterate over the array starting from the second element (index 1).
// for each element, create a new node and set its prev pointer to the previous node.
// link the next pointer of the previous node to the new node.
// update the prev variable to the new node.
// finally, print the head of the doubly linked list.
// TC: O(N), to traverse the array n-1 times so overall time complexity is O(N).
// SC: O(N), as for 'n' size it create 'n' nodes.
