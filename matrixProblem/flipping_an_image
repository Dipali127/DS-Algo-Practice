// Leetcode Problem:
// appraoch:- first iterate through the matrix to flip an image horizontally means that reverse
// each row (swap each row value which are before or on the midlle of the row with value which are after 
// the middle of the row).
// once each row is reversed again iterate through the reverse matrix to invert the matrix means that
// changing 0s to 1 and 1s to 0.
// TC:O(N^2) as the below code use twice nested loop that is once for image
// flipping and other for image inverting.
// SC:- O(1), since no additional space is used.

var flipAndInvertImage = function(image) {
    let m = image.length;
    let n = image[0].length;
    for(let i = 0; i < image.length; i++){

            image[i][n-j-1] = temp;
