// Leetcode Problem:
// appraoch:- first iterate through the matrix to flip an image horizontally means that reverse
// each row (swap each row value which are before or on the midlle of the row with value which are after 
// the middle of the row).
// once each row is reversed again iterate through the reverse matrix to invert the matrix means that
// changing 0s to 1 and 1s to 0.
// TC:O(N^2) as the below code use twice nested loop that is once for image
// flipping and other for image inverting AND SC:O(N^2) as the result matrix is of the same
// size of the given matrix to store all the values of the matrix. 

var flipAndInvertImage = function(image) {
    let row = image.length;
    let col = image[0].length;

    for(let i=0;i<row;i++){

            let temp = image[i][j];
            image[i][j] = image[i][col-j-1];
            image[i][col-j-1] = temp;
