// approach:- outer loop iterate through each row and before moving inside inner loop first 
// check condition that if row is
// even then start printing value of matrix from left to right and if row is odd then start
// printing value from right to left.
//  TC:O(N^2) as the outer loop runs n times, where n is the number of rows in the matrix and
// at each iteration of the outer loop, there's an inner loop. When the index i is even, 
// the inner loop runs n times, and when i is odd, it also runs n times.
// So, in total, the number of iterations is 2 * n * n, which is O(2n^2) and after neglecting
// constant the TC:O(N^2) and SC:O(N^2) as the output array stores all the elements of the 
// matrix in snake pattern.
// Since the size of the output array is proportional to the number of elements in 
// the matrix (which is n * n for an n x n matrix), the space complexity is O(N^2) as well.
