// GFG PROBLEM:
// appraoch:- 
// take a dummyNode and set its next pointer to the head of the linked list.
// this helps to manage the case where the head node itself is a node that needs to be deleted.
// traverse the given linked list. Initialize count to 0.
// check if count is equal to k. If it is, delete that node from the linked list using the prev and itrt pointers.
// meanwhile, increment the itrt and prev pointers.
// reset count to 0 if a node is deleted.
// Time Complexity: O(N) for iterating through the linked list.
// Space Complexity: O(1) as no extra space is used, only a few extra pointers.
