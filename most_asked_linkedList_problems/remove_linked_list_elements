// Leetcode Problem:-
// appraoch:- first check a case where head value itself equal to given val then update head 
// to point to the next node until the head node's value is not equal to val or the head becomes null.
// Use two pointers, itrt (iterator) to traverse the list and prev to keep track of the previous node.
// If the current node's value is equal to val, update the prev.next to itrt.next to skip the current node.
// If the current node's value is not equal to val, move the prev pointer to the current node.
// Move the itrt pointer to the next node in each iteration.
 // TC:O(N) to iterate through linked list and SC:O(1)

var removeElements = function (head, val) {
    // Handle the case where the head node needs to be removed
    while (head !== null && head.val === val) {
        head = head.next;
    }
    let itrt = head;
    let prev = null;
    while (itrt != null) {
        if (itrt.val === val) {
            prev.next = itrt.next;
            itrt = itrt.next;
        } else {
            prev = itrt;
            itrt = itrt.next;
        }
    }

    return head;
