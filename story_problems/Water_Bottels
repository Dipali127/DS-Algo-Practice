// Initially, we have numBottles which contains the total number of bottles filled with water.
// numExchange contains the number of empty bottles needed to exchange for one full water bottle.
// Example: If you have 9 bottles which are full of water, and it is given in the question that you can
// exchange 4 empty bottles to get one full water bottle, you need to return the total number of bottles
// you can drink.

// The Below function calculates the total number of bottles that can be drunk, including those obtained through exchanges.
// TC: O(log(numBottles)) as we are dividing numBottles by numExchange in each iteration and SC: O(1).
