// Brute force appraoch: simple simulation technique (just do what the question says)
// initially we have numBottles given which contain the total number of bottles which are filled
// with water and numExchange contain the number of bottles which you can excahnge with 
// empty water bottle to get one full water bottle.
// example:- if you have 9 bottles which are full of water and there given in question that you can
// empty 4 bottles to get one full water bottle and you have to return the number of bottles which
// you emptied.
// TC:O(N) and SC:O(1).
