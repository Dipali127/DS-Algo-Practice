// merge sort is based on divide and conquer algorithm which recursively divide the array into subarray until the 
// size of the array becomes one.
// once the size of the array becomes one, merge function merge the array until the array will be completely merge.
//
// Time Complexity: O(N logN)
// - The mergeSort function recursively divides the array into two halves, which takes O(logN).
// - At each level of mergeSort(), the merge() function is called to merge all elements, 
//   which takes O(N) time.
// - Therefore, the overall time complexity in the worst, best, and average cases is O(N logN).
//
// Space Complexity: O(N)
// - O(logN) space is required for the recursive function call stack.
// - O(N) extra space is required to store the left and right subarrays during merging.
// - O(N) temporary space is also used for storing the merged output.
// - Overall space complexity = O(N) (since O(logN) is negligible compared to O(N)).
