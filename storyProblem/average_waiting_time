// leetcode Problem:
// appraoch:- simple simulation technique(just do what question says)
 // below loop iterate through each customer, and for each customer, we have to calculate the waiting
 // time based on their arrival time and the time taken by chef to complete their order.
 // once calculate the waiting time add it to the totalwaitingTime to find the average waiting time
 // of all the customers.
 // also you need to check the arrival time for each customer if there is case that arrival time is
 // more than order finish time it means that chef take new order from customer's arrival time .
 // TC:O(N) to iterate through each customer to calculate the totalwaitingTime and SC:O(1)
 
var averageWaitingTime = function (customers) {
    let averagewaitingTime = 0;
    let totalwaitingTime = 0;
    let orderfinishTime = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < customers.length; i++) {
        let arrivalTime = customers[i][0];
        let orderTime = customers[i][1];
        if (orderfinishTime < arrivalTime) {
            orderfinishTime = arrivalTime;
        }
        orderfinishTime += orderTime;
        totalwaitingTime += orderfinishTime - arrivalTime;
    }

    averagewaitingTime = totalwaitingTime / customers.length;
    return averagewaitingTime;
