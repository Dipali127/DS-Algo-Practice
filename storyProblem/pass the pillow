 // leetcode Problem:
 // Approach: Simple simulation technique (just do what the question says)
// Initially, the first person in the line holds the pillow (`person = 1`).
// The `direction` starts as `true`, indicating passing from left to right.
// Time starts from 1 second.
// During each pass of the pillow, time is incremented by 1 second.
// If the person reaches the end, reverse the direction to pass the pillow in the opposite order.
// If the person reaches the start again, change the direction again.
// Finally, return the index of the person holding the pillow after `time` seconds.
// Time Complexity: O(time), as we iterate from 1 second to `time` seconds and SC:O(1).
var passThePillow = function(n, time) {
    let person = 1;
    let direction = true; // true means passing from 1 to n, false means passing from n to 1
    
    for (let t = 1; t <= time; t++) {
        if (direction) {
            person ++;
        } else {
            person --;
        }
        
        // Check if we reach the ends and need to change direction
        if (person  === 0) {
            direction = true;
            currentPerson = 2;
        } else if (person  === n + 1) {
            direction = false;
            person  = n - 1;
        }
    }
    
    return person ;
