// approach:- brute force appraoch
// since there is no option to traverse linked list from last, i will calculate the length of the linked list so that
// i can easily find the posistion from start of the given linked list to remove the nth node of linked list from end.
// once calculate the length of list, check a case if length is equal to given n , it means that head is the
// node to deleted and return head.next.
// otherwise, Calculate the position of the node just before the deleted node by subtracting n from length.
// and traverse to this node and delete the node once reach at the node just before deleted node.
// TC: O(N), Explanation:-
// O(N) to calculate the length 
// O(N) to reach the postion before the deleted node
// overall TC: O(N)+O(N) = O(2N) = O(N) 
// SC: O(1), as we are only using a constant amount of extra space.

// Optimal appraoch:- using Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm (slow and fast pointer).
// initialize two pointers, fast and slow, both pointing to the head of the list.
// i will move the fast pointer to n steps which ensures that when the fast pointer reaches the end
// the slow pointer will be at the node just before the node we have to remove.
// if fast becomes null after the initial for loop, it means the node to be removed is the head node. 
// otherwise, move both fast and slow pointers one step at a time until fast.next is null. 
// TC: O(N),Explanation:-
// O(N) for moving the fast pointer n steps .
// O(N) for moving both fast and slow pointers until fast reaches the end.
// overall TC: O(N)+O(N) = O(N).
// SC: O(1), as we are only using a constant amount of extra space.
